# Platform Component Map

## Purpose

This document provides the architectural map of the M-DevOps platform.

Its goal is to help engineers quickly understand:

* Platform structure
* Component relationships
* Deployment flow
* Ownership boundaries
* Troubleshooting starting points

This document should be read before performing major platform changes, rebuild activities, or troubleshooting.

# Platform Overview

The platform implements a complete DevOps delivery pipeline using:

```text
Python Application
        ↓
Docker
        ↓
GitHub
        ↓
GitHub Actions
        ↓
GHCR
        ↓
ArgoCD
        ↓
Kubernetes
        ↓
Validation
```

Each component has a clearly defined responsibility.

# Deployment Artifact Flow

The application artifact moves through the platform as follows:

```text
app.py
        ↓
Docker Build
        ↓
Container Image
        ↓
GHCR
        ↓
ArgoCD
        ↓
Kubernetes Deployment
        ↓
Running Pod
```

This is the primary software delivery path.

---

# Golden Path Flow

Validated delivery workflow:

```text
Developer Change
        ↓
Git Commit
        ↓
Git Push
        ↓
GitHub Actions
        ↓
Quality Checks
        ↓
Docker Build
        ↓
GHCR Publication
        ↓
ArgoCD Sync
        ↓
Kubernetes Deployment
        ↓
Validation
```

This is the platform's Golden Path.

# Troubleshooting Ownership Map

When a problem occurs:

| Symptom                 | Start Here         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Commit / Push Issue     | Git & GitHub       |
| Pipeline Failure        | GitHub Actions     |
| Container Build Failure | Docker             |
| Missing Image           | GHCR               |
| Sync Failure            | ArgoCD             |
| Pod Failure             | Kubernetes         |
| Runtime Failure         | Application        |
| Unknown Issue           | Validation Scripts |

# Platform Recovery Sequence

When rebuilding or recovering the platform:

```text
Workstation
        ↓
Repository
        ↓
Docker
        ↓
GitHub
        ↓
GHCR
        ↓
Kubernetes
        ↓
ArgoCD
        ↓
Validation
```

Recovery should follow this order.

---

# Most Important Files

The following files are considered platform-critical:

```text
app.py

Dockerfile

requirements.txt

.github/workflows/ci.yml

k8s/apps/root-app.yml

verify_all.ps1
```

Changes to these files should be reviewed carefully.

# Success Criteria

This document is complete when an engineer can answer:

* What components exist?
* What does each component do?
* How do components interact?
* Where should troubleshooting start?
* How does software move through the platform?
* Which files are most important?

The engineer should be capable of understanding the complete platform architecture within a few minutes.
